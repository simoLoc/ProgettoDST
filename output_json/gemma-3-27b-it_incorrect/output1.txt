## OUTPUT
- System: Now that Cookit has started, what kind of notification would you like to receive? And where should I send it?
- User: Just let me know when it’s done. 
ERROR: trigger_channel: 'Home Connect Cookit'

Belief State: {'trigger_title': 'Cookit started'}
End BF
- System: Ok, so you want a notification when cooking is done, triggered by the end of a program. But how can I identify which program ended? Do you want to be notified for any program or a specific one?
- User: I want to be notified when a cooking program finishes. Specifically, trigger when a cooking program ends with 'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit' and 'trigger_title': 'Cooking program finished'.

End BF
- System: Great! So we're set up to trigger when a cooking program finishes on your Home Connect Cookit. Now, regarding the specific kitchen ID, can you tell me which kitchen this applies to?
- User: The kitchen ID is 'kitchen'.

End BF
- System: Okay, so the trigger is set for when a cooking program finishes in kitchen 'kitchen'. Now, thinking about what happens next – would you like me to play music on your Android device when that occurs? What kind of music or action are you envisioning?
- User: Yes, I want something to happen with my phone.
