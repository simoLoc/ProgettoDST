Belief State: {}
End BF
- System: Ok, so you want something to happen when your Cookit appliance begins a cooking program. Is there anything specific about the start of the program that would be relevant? For instance, are you interested in all programs or only certain ones?
- User: I’d like something to happen when my Home Connect Cookit appliance starts any cooking program.
Belief State: {'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started'}
End BF
- System: Now that we’ve established the trigger for when your Cookit starts, could you tell me more about how you would like to identify the appliance and what kind of ID it has? 
- User: I want to be notified when any of my appliances start cooking. I don't really care about IDs right now.




Belief State: {'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started'}
End BF
- System: You mentioned you don’t care about IDs right now, but understanding which Cookit appliance is starting could be useful for more specific notifications. Are you sure you wouldn't like to specify an ID for filtering?
- User: Yes, I understand. The Ha ID is '12345'. My trigger_fields_values are ''kitchen''.
Belief State: {'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started', 'trigger_fields_values': "'kitchen'", 'trigger_fields': 'Ha ID (Dropdown list)'}
End BF
- System: Now that we've set up the trigger based on the 'kitchen' area and ID, what action would you like to happen when this event occurs?
- User: I want you to play music. My action_title is 'Play music'.
Belief State: {'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started', 'trigger_fields_values': "'kitchen'", 'trigger_fields': 'Ha ID (Dropdown list)', 'action_title': 'Play music'}
End BF
- System: Great! Now that we know you want to play music when triggered, on which Android device would you like the music to play?
- User: I'd like it to play on my phone. My action_channel is 'Android Device'. 
Belief State: {'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started', 'trigger_fields_values': "'kitchen'", 'trigger_fields': 'Ha ID (Dropdown list)', 'action_title': 'Play music', 'action_channel': 'Android Device'}

- System: Okay, and what action do you want me to perform on your Android device? 
- User: There are no further details needed for this action. I confirm that there aren't any specific fields to fill out.
