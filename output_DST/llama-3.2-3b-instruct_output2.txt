Here is an example of an incremental conversation between the user and the system, as described:

### Initial Belief State
Frame(trigger_channel = ''; trigger_title = ''; trigger_fields = ''; action_channel = ''; action_title = '';  action_fields = '')

### User Utterance 1
User: I would like to receive notifications when my Home Connect Cookit device is started.
    Frame(trigger_channel = 'Home Connect Cookit'; trigger_title = 'Cookit started'; trigger_fields = ''; action_channel = ''; action_title = ''; action_fields = '')

### System Utterance 1
System: Got it! To set up this rule, I need to know which device you want to use as the trigger. Do you have a specific one in mind?
    Frame(trigger_channel = 'Home Connect Cookit'; trigger_title = 'Cookit started'; trigger_fields = ''; action_channel = ''; action_title = ''; action_fields = '')

### User Utterance 2
User: Yes, I have an Android device.
    Frame(trigger_channel = 'Home Connect Cookit'; trigger_title = 'Cookit started'; trigger_fields = ''; action_channel = 'Android Device'; action_title = ''; action_fields = '')

### System Utterance 2
System: Great choice! What do you want to use to track when the Cookit device is started? Would you like me to check a specific button or feature?
    Frame(trigger_channel = 'Home Connect Cookit'; trigger_title = 'Cookit started'; trigger_fields = ''; action_channel = 'Android Device'; action_title = ''; action_fields = '')

### System Utterance 3
System: Perfect! Now, on the Android device, what should I be looking for in your notifications to enable sending a music command?
    Frame(trigger_channel = 'Home Connect Cookit'; trigger_title = 'Cookit started'; trigger_fields = 'Ha ID (Dropdown list)'; action_channel = 'Android Device'; action_title = 'Play music'; action_fields = '')

### System Utterance 4
