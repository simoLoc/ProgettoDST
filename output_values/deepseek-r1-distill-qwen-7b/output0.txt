Okay, so I need to figure out how to generate trigger_fields_values and action_fields_values based on the given trigger and action fields. Let me start by understanding the problem again.

First, the trigger part has:
- Trigger Channel: Department of Agriculture
- Trigger Title: New open recall
- Trigger Fields: 'Query (Text input > Other)'

And the action part has:
- Action Channel: Email
- Action Title: Send me an email
- Action Fields: 'Subject (Text input > Title), Body (Text input > HTML)'

From the example provided, when trigger_fields is empty, trigger_fields_values is also empty. That makes sense because if there are no fields, you don't need any values.

Now, looking at the action fields. The action_fields string has two parts separated by commas: 'Subject (Text input > Title)' and 'Body (Text input > HTML)'. Each part represents a field name and its corresponding format.

So for Subject, it's a Text input of type Title. I need to generate a realistic subject line for an email. It should be relevant to the action title "Send me an email" and specific enough without being too vague. Maybe something like "New Important Update from the Department of Agriculture".

For Body, it's a Text input of type HTML. Since emails can have HTML content, I should generate a realistic body that includes some links or maybe bullet points for clarity. But since the format says 'HTML', perhaps a simple HTML email body with placeholders.

Wait, but in the output example, action_fields_values is a list where each field's value is given as a string. So the Subject would be first, followed by Body. So I need to generate two strings here.

I should make sure that both fields have values and are correctly formatted. Also, since trigger_fields was 'Query (Text input > Other)', but in this case, action_fields has two parts. So the user's current input doesn't include any empty fields except perhaps the trigger's, which is already handled.

Let me think about realistic values:

Subject: It should be clear and concise, something like "Notice of Open Recall for [specific topic]".

Body: Since it's HTML, I can create a simple email body with links to some relevant documents or actions. For example, a greeting, an announcement, and specific links.

So putting it all together, the action_fields_values should be an array where the first element is the subject line as a string, and the second element is the generated HTML body.

trigger_fields: ''  
trigger_fields_values: ''  

action_channel: 'Email'  
action_title: 'Send me an email'  
action_fields: 'Subject (Text input > Title), Body (Text input > HTML)'  
action_fields_values: ['Notice of Open Recall for Policy Update', '<html><body>Dear staff,<br />\nPlease be informed about the upcoming open recall on agricultural policies.
