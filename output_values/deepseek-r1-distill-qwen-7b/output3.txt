Okay, I need to help generate trigger_fields_values and action_fields_values based on the given input. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, looking at the current input:

Trigger:
- trigger_channel: 'Weather Underground'
- trigger_title: 'Today's weather report'
- trigger_fields: 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)'

Action:
- action_channel: 'Notifications'
- action_title: 'Send a notification from the IFTTT app'
- action_fields: 'Message (Text input)'

From the exception rules, if either trigger_fields or action_fields is empty, their respective fields_values should also be empty. In this case, both have non-empty fields, so we need to generate values.

The example provided shows that action_fields_values can be an array of strings where each corresponds to a field value in order. For the action_fields given here, 'Message (Text input)', the output is ['...', ...], which seems like it's a list with one element for each message.

But wait, looking at the example again: action_fields was just 'Message', but action_fields_values had two elements because of maybe using a different structure? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Wait no, in the example, the trigger_fields were empty, so trigger_fields_values is also an empty string. Action_fields had one field with format specified, and the value was a single string.

Wait, looking at the example input:

Trigger:
trigger_fields: '' → trigger_fields_values: ''

Action:
action_fields: 'Link URL (Text input > Link), Message (Text input)' 
action_fields_values: ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz_XGeAzn14&rco=1', 'This is my favourite song!!!']

So, action_fields_values was a list of two strings because there were two fields.

In the current input, the action_fields have one field: 'Message (Text input)'. So, I think action_fields_values should be an array with one element. But in the example, even if it's just one field, why was it presented as an array? Because maybe each field corresponds to a value position.

Wait, no. In the current input, trigger_fields are two: Time and Location. Action_fields is only Message. So action_fields_values will have one value corresponding to Message.

But in the example, when action_fields had two fields, they were converted into two elements in the list.

So, perhaps each field corresponds to a position in the array. Therefore, for an action_fields of 'Message (Text input)', we need to generate just one string and put it in a single-element list.

Wait, but looking at the example again: action_fields had two fields, so their values were a list with two strings. So yes, each field's value is added as an element in order.

So in our case:

Action_field: 'Message (Text input)' → needs to generate one string and put it in a list as [value].

But looking at the trigger_fields, they have Time and Location. These are fields that might need values too, but for triggers, do we always need to provide them?

Wait, in the example given, trigger_fields were empty, so trigger_fields_values was ''. But here, trigger_fields are not empty: 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)'. So each of these needs corresponding fields_values.

But looking at the output from the user's example:

In their output, they only provided action_fields_values as a list. The trigger_fields_values is also present but empty if it was empty. But in this case, since trigger_fields are specified, we need to provide non-empty values.

Wait no: exception rules state that if fields (trigger or action) are empty, then the fields_values should be ''. However, when fields are not empty, they must have corresponding value fields.

So for the current input:

Trigger has two fields: Time and Location. Therefore, trigger_fields_values must be a string with two values separated by commas, each in their specific format.

Action has one field: Message → action_fields_values is an array of one element.

But wait, looking at the example provided by the user:

Input:
trigger_fields: 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)'
action_fields: 'Message (Text input)'

In this case, trigger_fields_values would be Time and Location values, each in their format. Action_fields_values is Message.

But wait, in the output example they provided for action_fields_values, it was a list with two strings because there were two fields. So perhaps each field corresponds to an element in the array regardless of its type or input method.

So, if trigger_fields are Time and Location (both Text inputs), then their values should be generated as per format: e.g., '14:00' for Time and a place name for Location.

Similarly, action_fields is Message (Text Input) → just one string.

But in the user's example output:

trigger_fields_values was empty because trigger_fields were empty. But here, they are not empty.

Wait, looking back at the exception rules: If trigger_fields or action_fields is empty, their fields_values must be ''. So when trigger_fields are present (as 'Time' and 'Location'), then trigger_fields_values cannot be empty; it has to have values for each field.

Similarly, action_fields are non-empty, so action_fields_values should be a list with the appropriate number of elements.

So:

Trigger:
- Trigger Channel: YouTube
- Trigger Title: New liked video
- Trigger Fields: Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)
  → These two fields require values. For example, '14:00' for Time and 'London, UK' for Location.

Action:
- Action Channel: Facebook Pages
- Action Title: Create a link post
- Action Fields: Message (Text input) 
  → So one field requiring a string like 'This is my favorite song!'.

Wait, but the user's output in their example was:

action_fields_values as ['https://www.youtube.com/...', 'This is ...'], which seems to have two elements. But wait, looking again: no, actually, in that case, action_fields were two fields, so the list had two strings.

In our current input, action_fields has one field, so action_fields_values should be an array with a single element.

But trigger_fields have two fields, so trigger_fields_values will be a string with two values separated by commas and spaces, each in their respective formats.

Wait, no: looking at the example:

Trigger: 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)'
Action: 'Message (Text input)'

In the output for action_fields_values, it was ['https://...', 'This is ...'], which seems to correspond to two fields. So if our action has only one field, we need an array with just one element.

Wait, no: in the example given by the user, action_fields were two fields, so they generated a list of two strings. In our case, since action_fields has only one, it should be a single-element list.

But looking back at the problem statement:

The exception rules say that if trigger_fields or action_fields is empty, then their respective values are empty. So in this case, both have non-empty fields, so we need to generate the corresponding value lists.

Now, considering how to format each field's value based on its type and format:

Trigger fields:
1. Time: likely a string representing time, perhaps in 24-hour format like '14:00'
2. Location: a place name, maybe 'London, UK' or another location

Action field:
1. Message: any text that looks real, so something like 'This is my favorite song!'

So putting it together:

trigger_fields_values should be 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)' → their respective values would be in order.

Wait no: the trigger_fields are Time and Location; each has a specific format. So the trigger_fields_values will have two elements, separated by commas, with each element matching their field's format.

So for example:

Time could be '14:00' (Text input)
Location could be 'London, UK'

Thus, trigger_fields_values would be "14:00, London, UK"

Similarly, action_fields has Message as Text input → value is a string like 'This is my favorite song!'

So action_fields_values = ['This is ...']

Wait, but in the user's example output for the action_fields_values, they provided two strings because there were two fields. So if we have only one field here, it should be an array with just that one element.

But looking at their example:

They had trigger_fields as '' and action_fields as 'Link URL ... , Message (Text input)', so action_fields had two fields → action_fields_values was a list of two elements.

In our case, the action_fields is only 'Message' → action_fields_values should be an array with one element. But wait, in their example, even when they had only one field for trigger and none for action (trigger_fields empty), action_fields_values was ['...'], which seems off because if action_fields are present, but no fields were specified as optional.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that each field corresponds to a specific position in the list.

So:

- For trigger_fields:
   - Each field has its own format: e.g., Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)
   → So two fields, so trigger_fields_values should have two values separated by commas.

- For action_fields:
   - Only Message (Text input) → one value in the list.

So putting it all together:

Trigger_fields_values would be "14:00, London, UK"

But wait, no. Because each field has its own format, which includes the type and what to put in. So for Time, maybe 'Time' as a string formatted like 'HH:mm', but perhaps with more options.

Wait, looking at how it's presented:

Each trigger_field is defined as "Field Name (Type input) > Format"

So, for example: 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)' → so Time is of type Text input with no further formatting. Similarly, Location is a Location input but requires more info.

But the actual value depends on what makes sense in real usage. So Time can be represented as '14:00', Location as 'London, UK'.

So trigger_fields_values = "14:00, London, UK"

Action_fields is 'Message (Text input)' → so message is just a string like 'This is my favorite song!'

Thus, action_fields_values would be ['This is ...']

Wait, but in the example output provided by the user:

Input:
trigger_fields: 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)'
action_fields: 'Message (Text input)'

Output had:
action_fields_values: ['https://...', 'This is ...'], which suggests that each field's value was placed into a list, with as many elements as the number of fields.

Wait no, in their example, action_fields were two fields, so it was a list of two strings. So if we have only one field here, it should be a list with just one string.

But looking back at the user's problem statement:

They provided an example where trigger_fields are empty and action_fields has two fields → output had action_fields_values as ['...', ...], which is a list of two elements.

So in our case, since action_fields have one field, action_fields_values should be ['value'].

Similarly, for trigger_fields with two fields: 'Time' and 'Location', their values would each correspond to the format given. So Time could be like '14:00' (Text input), Location as a string like 'London, UK'.

Thus:

trigger_fields_values = "14:00, London, UK"

action_fields_values = ["This is my favorite song!"]

But wait, in the example output from the user, action_fields had two fields but their values were each an individual string. So I think that's correct.

Wait no, looking at the example:

Input:
trigger_fields: 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)'
action_fields: 'Link URL (Text input > Link), Message (Text input)'

Output for action_fields_values had two strings in a list.

Thus, when there are multiple fields, it's an array with each field's value. So if we have only one field, the array should still be present, even if it has just one element.

But looking at the example from user: action_fields were 'Link URL ... , Message...' → two fields → list of two strings.

So in our case, since action_fields is only 'Message', then action_fields_values would be ['...'] with a single string inside.

But wait, I'm getting confused because in the example, they had trigger_fields as empty (so empty string) and action_fields with two fields. The output for action_fields was an array of two strings.

In our case, since trigger_fields are not empty, their values have to be non-empty; same for action_fields_values.

So putting it all together:

Trigger:
- Time: 14:00 (Text input)
- Location: London, UK

Action:
- Message: "This is my favorite song!"

Thus, the output would be:

trigger_fields: 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)'
→ trigger_fields_values: "14:00, London, UK"

action_fields: 'Message (Text input)'
→ action_fields_values: ["This is my favorite song!"]

But wait, in their example, the action_fields had two fields, so they were represented as a list of two strings. So if we have one field, it should be a single-element list.

Yes, that makes sense.

So final output:

trigger_channel: 'Weather Underground'
trigger_title: 'Today's weather report'
trigger_fields: 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)'
trigger_fields_values: "14:00, London, UK"

action_channel: 'Notifications'
action_title: 'Send a notification from the IFTTT app'
action_fields: 'Message (Text input)'
action_fields_values: ["This is my favorite song!"]

Wait, but in the user's example output for action_fields_values when there were two fields, it was ['https://...', '...'], which are two strings. So yes, even with one field, we need to have a list.

So that seems correct.
