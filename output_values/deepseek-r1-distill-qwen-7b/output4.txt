Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to generate the trigger_fields_values and action_fields_values based on the given trigger and action rules. The user provided an example where both trigger_fields and action_fields had values, but in their current input, both are empty except for trigger_fields being empty string. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data they gave. The trigger has a channel 'Pocket', title 'Any new item', and fields is an empty string. Similarly, the action has a channel 'Twitter', title 'Post a tweet with image', and fields as two text inputs: 'Tweet (Text input)' and 'Photo URL (Text input > Photo)'. 

Wait, in the example output, for action_fields_values they have ['https://...', 'This is ...']. So each field gets a value. But if both trigger_fields and action_fields are empty, then I guess we need to generate some placeholder values.

But looking back at the current input, the user wrote that trigger_fields is an empty string, not just empty list or something else. Similarly for action_fields, it's given as 'Tweet (Text input), Photo URL...' but in the example output, they used a comma-separated string without spaces. Wait, actually in their example, the action_fields was written with two fields separated by ', ', so maybe I need to adjust that.

Wait no, let me check: In the current input, under trigger_fields and action_fields, it's given as:

trigger_fields: ''
action_fields: 'Tweet (Text input), Photo URL (Text input > Photo)'

But in the example output for action_fields, they had 'Tweet (Text input > Tweet)', which is a bit different. Maybe I need to follow that structure.

Wait, perhaps the trigger_fields and action_fields are supposed to be lists of fields with their types, but if they're empty, then no values are needed except maybe placeholders like N/A or something. But since in the example output, even when fields were present, the values had specific URLs and text, I think we need to generate realistic-looking placeholder data.

Wait, perhaps trigger_fields_values is just an empty string because trigger_fields is empty. Similarly for action_fields_values. But looking at the example, when action_fields were specified, they generated actual strings. So maybe if trigger_fields or action_fields are present (i.e., not empty), we generate values; otherwise, leave them as empty.

But in the current input, both trigger_fields and action_fields are non-empty strings but with spaces? Wait no: trigger_fields is just an empty string '', while action_fields has two fields separated by commas. So perhaps I need to process each field name into a value that fits its type.

So for example, if action_fields is 'Tweet (Text input), Photo URL (Text input > Photo)', then we can generate two values: one for Tweet and one for Photo URL. The user's example generated ['https://...', 'This...'] which seems like a mix of URLs and text.

But in the current case, since trigger_fields is empty, trigger_fields_values should be empty as well. For action_fields, it has two fields: Tweet (Text input) and Photo URL (Text input > Photo). So we need to generate values for each.

Wait, but looking at the example output, they only generated one value per field. Wait no, in the example, both fields were provided with their own values. So perhaps I should do that here as well.

But wait, in the current input, action_fields is specified as 'Tweet (Text input), Photo URL (Text input > Photo)'. But in the output from the example, it's written as a list: ['https://...', 'This...']. So maybe when action_fields are present, we generate a comma-separated string of values for each field.

But I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The user's current input is:

trigger_channel: 'Pocket'
trigger_title: 'Any new item'
trigger_fields: ''

action_channel: 'Twitter'
action_title: 'Post a tweet with image'
action_fields: 'Tweet (Text input), Photo URL (Text input > Photo)'

So, action_fields has two fields. Therefore, action_fields_values should be an array of two values.

But in the example output, when action_fields had two fields, they generated a list with two strings, each corresponding to a field.

Wait, no: in the example, action_fields were 'Link URL (Text input > Link), Message (Text input)', and their action_fields_values was ['https://...', 'This...'] which is a list of two values. So I think that's how it should be.

But in our current case, action_fields has two fields: 'Tweet (Text input)' and 'Photo URL (Text input > Photo)'. So we need to generate two values here as well.

However, the user's example had both trigger_fields and action_fields non-empty, but also specific types. In this case, since trigger_fields is empty string, trigger_fields_values should be empty. For action_fields, it has two fields: Tweet (Text input) and Photo URL (Text input > Photo). So we need to generate two values.

But the user's example had both trigger and action fields with non-empty strings but in a specific format, leading to generated fields_values being lists of actual data. But when they are empty, like in this current case, trigger_fields is empty string so trigger_fields_values is also an empty string.

Wait, no: In the EXCEPTION RULES section, it says if trigger_fields is empty, then trigger_fields_values must be empty as well. Similarly for action_fields.

So, since trigger_fields is '', then trigger_fields_values should be ''. For action_fields, which has two fields, we need to generate a list of values, each corresponding to their field.

But the user's example had both trigger and action fields with non-empty strings (trigger_fields was empty string?), but in the output, they generated actual data for action_fields.

Wait no: In the current input, action_fields is given as 'Tweet (Text input), Photo URL (Text input > Photo)', which is two fields. So we need to generate a list of two values.

But how do I know what data type each field is? The trigger_fields and action_fields are in the format like 'Field name (Type Input)'. For example, in the current case: 'Tweet (Text input)' and 'Photo URL (Text input > Photo)'.

Wait, perhaps 'Tweet' has type 'Text input', and 'Photo URL' has type 'Text input > Photo'? Or maybe it's more specific. I'm not sure. Maybe each field is just a name with its type description.

But for generating the values, we can assume that each field requires an actual value. For 'Tweet (Text input)', perhaps generate a string like "New tweet about something". For 'Photo URL (Text input > Photo)', maybe a URL string.

So in this case, action_fields_values would be ['https://...', 'This is ...'] similar to the example output.

But wait, in the user's current input, they have action_fields as two fields: 'Tweet (Text input)' and 'Photo URL (Text input > Photo)'. In their example, when both trigger and action had non-empty fields, it generated specific values. So perhaps here, we can generate something like ['https://...', 'A photo link'].

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe each field needs to be handled based on its type. For example, 'Tweet' could have a URL or text value, while 'Photo URL' is specifically a URL.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that for action_fields, we need to generate as many values as there are fields, with realistic-looking data. So if there are two fields, each gets a generated value.

But in the current case, the trigger_fields is empty string, so no values needed for that. Action_fields has two fields, so action_fields_values should be an array of two values.

So putting it all together:

trigger_channel: 'Pocket'
trigger_title: 'Any new item'
trigger_fields: '' → trigger_fields_values: ''

action_channel: 'Twitter'
action_title: 'Post a tweet with image'
action_fields: 'Tweet (Text input), Photo URL (Text input > Photo)' → action_fields_values: ['https://...', 'This is ...']

But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Maybe each field should be treated separately, but perhaps the user expects just one value per line.

Wait, looking back at the example output, when action_fields had two fields with their types, they generated a list of two values. So in this case, since there are two fields, we need to generate a list of two strings.

Therefore, for action_fields_values, it would be ['https://...', 'This is ...'] where each value corresponds to one field.

So finalizing:

trigger_fields_values: ''
action_fields_values: ['https://example.com', 'Sample text']

But perhaps using more realistic placeholders. For example, the first link could be a YouTube URL since trigger is from Pocket, but action is on Twitter. Hmm, maybe that's not relevant. Alternatively, just use generic placeholders.

Alternatively, if we're supposed to generate placeholders as in the example where they used 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...' and some text, perhaps for this case:

action_fields_values: ['https://example.com', 'A description here']

But I'm not sure about the exact URLs or texts. Maybe just use sample data that looks realistic.

Alternatively, if action_fields are defined as specific types, like 'Tweet (Text input)' could be any string, and 'Photo URL' must be a valid URL. So for 'Tweet', maybe "New post about something", and for 'Photo URL', "https://example.com/photo".

But I think the best approach is to generate realistic-looking values that fit each field.

So in conclusion:

trigger_fields_values: ''
action_fields_values: ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=123', 'A great new item arrived!']

Wait, but maybe it's better to use dummy URLs and texts. Alternatively, perhaps the example output used specific examples, so for this case, we can follow that.

But since I don't have exact data, I think just providing placeholder values is acceptable, as per the user's instruction.
