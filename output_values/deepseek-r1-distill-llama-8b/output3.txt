Okay, so I need to generate trigger_fields_values and action_fields_values based on the given trigger-action rules. Let me try to understand what's required here. 

First, I'll look at the example provided. The input had trigger_channel: 'YouTube', trigger_title: 'New liked video', and trigger_fields were empty. The output also left trigger_fields_values as empty. Then for action, they had action_channel: 'Facebook Pages', action_title: 'Create a link post', and action_fields with two fields. The values generated looked like realistic examples, like the URL from YouTube and a message.

So in the current input, the trigger is 'Weather Underground' with a title 'Today's weather report' and trigger_fields as 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)'. Action is 'Notifications', 'Send a notification...' with action_fields as 'Message (Text input)'.

I need to make sure that the generated values for both trigger_fields_values and action_fields_values are consistent with their types and don't change the meaning of the rule. Also, data should look realistic, like using real-sounding locations or messages.

For trigger_fields: Time is a Text input, so maybe something like "09:00 AM" or another time format. Location is a Point input, which I think means latitude and longitude, but perhaps as separate fields? Wait, in the example, they had two fields for location as separate points. Hmm, no, wait. The trigger_fields are 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)', so maybe each field is handled separately. So for Time, a Text value like "Current time: 10 AM", but since it's a field value, maybe just the time part like "10:00". For Location, as a Point, perhaps they need to provide coordinates. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, in the example, when trigger_fields were empty, the values were empty strings. So when there are fields, each field needs a value consistent with its type and description. So for 'Time (Text input)', maybe "10:00 AM" as a string. For 'Location (Location input > Point)', perhaps something like [(40.7128, -74.0060)], which is a New York City location point.

For the action_fields, it's 'Message (Text input)'. So that would be a single string, maybe "Today's weather report for New York City: Clear skies with temperatures reaching 72째F."

So putting this together, trigger_fields_values would be an array containing ["10:00", "(40.7128, -74.0060)"]. But wait, is each field separate or combined? Maybe as a list of tuples where each tuple has the field name and its value. Wait, but in the example, when there were no fields, it was left empty, but when there are fields, each field's value is listed.

Wait, in the initial output example, action_fields_values were ["https://www.youtube.com/...", "..."]. So for multiple fields, they list all possible values in an array. So if trigger_fields have two fields, their values would be in order corresponding to the fields.

So I think the structure should be:

trigger_fields_values: a list where each element is the value for each trigger_field in the same order as trigger_fields. Similarly for action_fields_values.

Therefore, for the current input, the trigger_fields are 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)'. So their values would be ["10:00", "(40.7128, -74.0060)"]. And for the action_fields, since it's one field, it's just ["Today's weather report..."].

Wait, but in the example, the action_fields were two fields and the output was an array of two values corresponding to each field. So same here, if action_fields have one field, the value is a single string.

I also need to ensure that all generated data seems realistic. For location, using real coordinates of a known place makes sense. For time, a valid format like 24-hour or AM/PM would work. For messages, it should make sense in context, like a weather notification.

Another thing: the exception rule says if trigger_fields is empty, then trigger_fields_values must be empty, and same for action_fields. So I need to check if fields are present before generating values.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Check if trigger_fields is empty:
   - If yes, trigger_fields_values = ""
   - Else, split into individual field descriptions.
2. For each trigger_field:
   a. Determine the type (e.g., Text input or Location input > Point).
   b. Generate a realistic value consistent with that type and description.
3. Do the same for action_fields.

So for the given example:

Trigger fields: 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)'

- Time: Text input, so generate something like "10:00 AM"
- Location: Point input, using real coordinates, maybe of a known location, like Central Park in NYC: "(40.7128, -74.0060)"

Action fields: 'Message (Text input)'
- Generate a message like "Today's weather report for New York City: Clear skies with temperatures reaching 72째F."

So putting it all together:

trigger_fields_values = ["10:00 AM", "(40.7128, -74.0060)"]
action_fields_values = ["Clear skies with temperatures reaching 72째F in New York City today!"]

Wait, but the format of location points might be different. Sometimes they're written as strings like "Point (latitude, longitude)". So maybe that's correct.

Also, considering the message, it should be natural and relevant to the weather report, so mentioning temperature makes sense.

I think that covers all parts. Now I need to make sure this is consistent with the rules provided.
</think>

**Solution:**

Given the trigger-action rule provided:

- **Trigger Channel:** Weather Underground
- **Trigger Title:** Today's weather report
- **Trigger Fields:** 'Time (Text input), Location (Location input > Point)'
  
- **Action Channel:** Notifications
- **Action Title:** Send a notification from the IFTTT app
- **Action Fields:** 'Message (Text input)'

Here are the generated values for both trigger and action fields:

### Trigger Fields Values:
```json
"trigger_fields_values": [
  "10:00 AM",
  "(40.7128, -74.0060)"
]
```

### Action Fields Values:
```json
"action_fields_values": [
  "Clear skies with temperatures reaching 72째F in New York City today!"
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Trigger Fields:**
   - **Time:** A realistic time value formatted as "10:00 AM".
   - **Location:** Real coordinates of a notable location, such as Central Park, represented as "(40.7128, -74.0060)".

2. **Action Fields:**
   - **Message:** A natural-sounding weather report message that includes relevant information like temperature and location context.

This solution ensures that the generated values align with the specified types and maintain the integrity of the trigger-action rule while appearing realistic and contextually appropriate.
