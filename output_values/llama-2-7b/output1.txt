The system generates trigger_fields_values and action_fields_values considering the type assumed by trigger_fields and action_fields respectively. The values to be generated must be consistent with the trigger-action rule provided as input. Accordingly, the values of trigger_fields_values and action_fields_values must not alter the meaning of the trigger-action rule.
