Trigger Action Rules refers to an event-based system. When a specific event occurs, it triggers a predefined action.
This helps connect different services so they can work together without manual effort. Trigger Action Rules refers to an event-based system.
The trigger-action rule is divided into two subparts, trigger and action, both containing channel, title and fields. The key concepts are:

trigger_channel: an entity providing various services.
trigger_title: a specific functionality or service offered by a trigger_channel.
trigger_fields: predefined type parameters required by a trigger_title to configure the exact behaviour of the event. Each trigger_field has a name and value and may be mandatory or optional.
action_channel: the entity that provides the action service resulting from the trigger.
action_title: a specific action_channel functionality that is executed when the trigger is activated.
action_fields: type parameters required to define the behaviour of the action executed by the action_title.
When the trigger is activated, the system automatically executes the associated action.
