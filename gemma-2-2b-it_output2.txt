**Initial Belief State:**
```json
{
  "trigger_channel": "",
  "trigger_title": "Cookit started",
  "trigger_fields": {}, 
  "action_channel": "Android Device", 
  "action_title": "Play music",
  "action_fields": {} 
}
```

**User:** Hey, can you help me set up a rule that plays music when my Cookit starts? 


**System:** Sure!  What type of Ha ID should be used to trigger this action? Choose from the list below.


**User:** I'd like to play the music when it starts on a **Ha 123**.

**System:** Great! You specified that you want to trigger the music playback with a "Ha 123" starting event.  Which device should this action be sent to?
    
**User:** It should be sent to my smart speaker.


**System:** Excellent! What kind of music would you like to play when your Cookit starts on Ha 123? You can select an existing playlist or start a new one by choosing the "New Playlist" option.

**User:**  I'd like to play a playlist called "My Happy Hits".


**System:**  Alright, we have that playlist ready! To activate this rule, you need to confirm it. 

**User:** Okay, I confirm that my rule is set correctly.
 

**Final Belief State:**
```json
{
  "trigger_channel": "Home Connect Cookit",
  "trigger_title": "Cookit started",
  "trigger_fields": {
    "Ha ID": "123"
  },
  "action_channel": "Android Device", 
  "action_title": "Play music",
  "action_fields": {"Playlist Name": "My Happy Hits"} 
}
```



**Explanation:**

* We begin with an initial belief state reflecting the provided rules.
* The user provides information about the Ha ID and the desired playlist name.
* The system confirms the settings.
* Finally, we update the belief state to reflect these changes in order for future utterances to be processed appropriately.
