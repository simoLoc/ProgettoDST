Here is an example of an incremental conversation between a user and a system based on the provided trigger-action rules:

**Initial Belief State:**

* trigger_channel = ''
* trigger_title = ''
* trigger_fields = ''
* action_channel = ''
* action_title = ''
* action_fields = ''

**Conversation:**

- User: I would like to create an automation that happens every time someone likes a video on YouTube.
    Frame(trigger_channel = 'YouTube'; trigger_title = 'New liked video'; trigger_fields = ''; action_channel = 'Facebook Pages'; action_title = 'Create a link post'; action_fields = '')
- System: Got it! I can help you set up this rule. Which platform do you want to use to track likes on YouTube?
- User: I use YouTube.
    Frame(trigger_channel = 'YouTube'; trigger_title = 'New liked video'; trigger_fields = ''; action_channel = 'Facebook Pages'; action_title = 'Create a link post'; action_fields = '')
- System: Good choice. What should I be looking for in your YouTube likes to enable sharing on Facebook?
- User: I would like you to check if the person who liked the video is also part of our Facebook page.
    Frame(trigger_channel = 'YouTube'; trigger_title = 'New liked video'; trigger_fields = 'User ID (Text input)'; action_channel = 'Facebook Pages'; action_title = 'Create a link post'; action_fields = '')
- System: Perfect, I will monitor the likes on your YouTube videos. On Facebook, would you like to share only the text of the like or also the video itself?
- User: I would like to share both the text and the video.
    Frame(trigger_channel = 'YouTube'; trigger_title = 'New liked video'; trigger_fields = 'User ID (Text input), Video URL (Text input > Video)'; action_channel = 'Facebook Pages'; action_title = 'Create a link post'; action_fields = '')
- System: Fine, I will share both the text and the video. What should I write in the post on Facebook? Do you want to use the same text as the YouTube comment or add something specific?
- User: Write 'Someone liked our new video! {video title}'.
    Frame(trigger_channel = 'YouTube'; trigger_title = 'New liked video'; trigger_fields = 'User ID (Text input), Video URL (Text input > Video), Message (Text input)'; action_channel = 'Facebook Pages'; action_title = 'Create a link post'; action_fields = '')
- System: Great, the post will be 'Someone liked our new video! {video title}'. The video will automatically be added to the post. Is there anything else you want to specify?
- User: No, that's fine.
    Frame(trigger_channel = 'YouTube'; trigger_title = 'New liked video'; trigger_fields = 'User ID (Text input), Video URL (Text input > Video), Message (Text input)'; action_channel = 'Facebook Pages'; action_title = 'Create a link post'; action_fields = '')
- System: Perfect, the rule has been set up! Whenever someone likes a video on YouTube that is part of our page, it will automatically be shared on Facebook with the text 'Someone liked our new video! {video title}' and the attached video.

**Final Belief State:**

* trigger_channel = 'YouTube'
* trigger_title = 'New liked video'
* trigger_fields = 'User ID (Text input), Video URL (Text input > Video), Message (Text input)'
* action_channel = 'Facebook Pages'
* action_title = 'Create a link post'
* action_fields = 'Link URL (Text input > Link), Tweet (Text input)'
