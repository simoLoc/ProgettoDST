## OUTPUT

System: Which action would you like your Android Device to perform?
User: I want my Android Device to send a notification.

{'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started', 'trigger_fields': 'Ha ID (Dropdown list)', 'trigger_fields_values': "'kitchen'", 'action_channel': 'Android Device'}
System: What music would you like to play on your Android Device?

Okay, I understand. Here's the generated System question and User response based on the input:

System: Since you want to play music, is there a specific artist or song you would like me to play?
User: No, just play something random.

{'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started', 'trigger_fields': 'Ha ID (Dropdown list)', 'trigger_fields_values': "'kitchen'", 'action_channel': 'Android Device', 'action_title': 'Play music', 'action_fields': ''}
Okay, I understand. Since both `action_fields` and `action_fields_values` are currently empty, there's no specific information to base a question on.  I will generate a generic prompt to start gathering action details.

**System:** What kind of action would you like to perform? Please specify the service or functionality you want to use.
**User:** I want to send an email.

{'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started', 'trigger_fields': 'Ha ID (Dropdown list)', 'trigger_fields_values': "'kitchen'", 'action_channel': 'Android Device', 'action_title': 'Play music', 'action_fields': '', 'action_fields_values': "''"}
