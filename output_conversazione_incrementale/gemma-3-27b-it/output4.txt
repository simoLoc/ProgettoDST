- User: I want to create a rule that triggers when something new happens on my Pocket account.
{'trigger_channel': 'Pocket'}

- System: Great! So you want a rule triggered by Pocket. What specifically on Pocket should trigger this rule? For instance, do you want to trigger when any new item is saved?
- User: Yes, I would like to trigger it when any new item is saved to my Pocket account.
{'trigger_channel': 'Pocket', 'trigger_title': 'Any new item'}

- System: Okay, now that we've set up the trigger for new items saved to Pocket, what action do you want to perform?
- User: There are no specific fields to configure for this trigger, so let’s move on to setting up the action. 




{'trigger_channel': 'Pocket', 'trigger_title': 'Any new item', 'trigger_fields': '', 'trigger_fields_values': ''}

- System: Great! Now that we've set up the trigger from Pocket, what action would you like to perform?
- User: I would like to share new saved items on Twitter. 




{'trigger_channel': 'Pocket', 'trigger_title': 'Any new item', 'trigger_fields': '', 'trigger_fields_values': '', 'action_channel': 'Twitter'}

- System: Okay, you want to share new saved items on Twitter. What text or image would you like to include in your tweet?

{'trigger_channel': 'Pocket', 'trigger_title': 'Any new item', 'trigger_fields': '', 'trigger_fields_values': '', 'action_channel': 'Twitter', 'action_title': 'Post a tweet with image'}
