Okay, I understand. Here's a user utterance based on the provided `action_channel`:

- User: I want to send notifications to my Android device when a trigger event occurs.



{'action_channel': 'Android Device'}

- System: Great! Now that we've set up notifications for your Android device, what kind of action would you like to perform on it? 
- User: I want to play music on my Android device when the trigger event occurs.
{'action_channel': 'Android Device', 'action_title': 'Play music'}

- System: Perfect! Now that we've decided to play music on your Android device when triggered, are there any specific details about *how* you’d like the music to be played? For example, do you have a preferred playlist or application?
- User: No further specifications needed. Just play some music. 




{'action_channel': 'Android Device', 'action_title': 'Play music', 'action_fields': '', 'action_fields_values': ''}

- System: Great! Now that we know you want notifications on your Android device, what event from Cookit would you like to trigger these notifications? 
- User: I want to receive a notification when a new recipe is started in Cookit – so when 'Cookit started' happens.
{'action_channel': 'Android Device', 'action_title': 'Play music', 'action_fields': '', 'action_fields_values': '', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started'}

- System: So you want notifications when a recipe starts in Cookit for your kitchen. Is that correct? 
- User: Yes, I would like to receive a notification when a new recipe is started in Cookit with ID 'kitchen'.
{'action_channel': 'Android Device', 'action_title': 'Play music', 'action_fields': '', 'action_fields_values': '', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started', 'trigger_fields': 'Ha ID (Dropdown list)', 'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_fields_values': "'kitchen'"}
