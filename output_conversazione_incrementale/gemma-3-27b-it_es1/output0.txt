Okay, I understand. Here's a user utterance based on the provided `action_channel`:

- User: I want to receive notifications via email when a trigger event occurs.



{'action_channel': 'Email'}

- System: So you want me to send an email when a trigger event occurs. What subject and body would you like for this email?
- User: The subject should be 'Recall Alert: Frozen Strawberries' and the body is '<p>Dear Recipient,</p><p>The Department of Agriculture has issued a recall for frozen strawberries due to potential Listeria contamination. Please see the attached link for more details and safety instructions.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Department of Agriculture Recall Notification System</p>'.
{'action_channel': 'Email', 'action_title': 'Send me an email', 'action_fields': 'Subject (Text input > Title), Body (Text input > HTML)', 'action_fields_values': "'Recall Alert: Frozen Strawberries', '<p>Dear Recipient,</p><p>The Department of Agriculture has issued a recall for frozen strawberries due to potential Listeria contamination. Please see the attached link for more details and safety instructions.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Department of Agriculture Recall Notification System</p>'"}

- System: Given the new recall from the Department of Agriculture regarding Frozen Strawberries and potential Listeria contamination, can you confirm the query you'd like me to use for this trigger?
- User: My query is 'Frozen Strawberries - Potential Listeria Contamination'. I want to receive notifications via email when a new open recall matching that query appears on the Department of Agriculture.
