- User: I want to play some music on my Android device whenever my Cookit cooking program starts.

{'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started', 'action_channel': 'Android Device', 'action_title': 'Play music'}
System: What ID do you want to associate with the Cookit start event?
User: I would like to use ID 12345.

{'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started', 'action_channel': 'Android Device', 'action_title': 'Play music', 'trigger_fields': 'Ha ID (Dropdown list)'}
System: Would you like me to specify an Ha ID for this trigger?
User: Yes, I would like it to be kitchen.

{'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started', 'action_channel': 'Android Device', 'action_title': 'Play music', 'trigger_fields': 'Ha ID (Dropdown list)', 'trigger_fields_values': "'kitchen'"}
Okay, I understand. Let's analyze the input and generate the System/User utterances.

**Based on the provided information:**

We know `trigger_fields_values` is already set to "kitchen". We need to determine what question the system should ask to fill in the missing `action_fields`. Since no details about trigger or action channels/titles are given, I'll make a reasonable assumption that this rule involves sending a notification.

**Here's the output:**

System: What kind of notification would you like to send?
User: I want to send a text message.

{'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started', 'action_channel': 'Android Device', 'action_title': 'Play music', 'trigger_fields': 'Ha ID (Dropdown list)', 'trigger_fields_values': "'kitchen'", 'action_fields': ''}
Okay, I understand. Here's the generated System question and User response based on the provided input:

Since `action_fields` is empty, there are no specific fields to ask about. Therefore, the system will not generate any questions. 

**System:** No further information needed at this time.
**User:** Okay.

{'trigger_channel': 'Home Connect Cookit', 'trigger_title': 'Cookit started', 'action_channel': 'Android Device', 'action_title': 'Play music', 'trigger_fields': 'Ha ID (Dropdown list)', 'trigger_fields_values': "'kitchen'", 'action_fields': '', 'action_fields_values': "''"}
